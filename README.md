This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## 1. Project Structure Overview

The repository contains a root called wm-banner/ with the following notable subdirectories and files:

### Configuration and Project Setup Files:
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: These files define the project’s dependencies and scripts, indicating that the project is built with Node.js.
- `tsconfig.json`: Indicates that the project uses TypeScript.
- `next.config.ts`: A configuration file for Next.js (the project’s framework).
- `postcss.config.mjs` and `eslint.config.mjs`: Configuration files for PostCSS (CSS processing) and ESLint (code linting).

### Source Code:
The source code is contained within the src/ directory.

#### `src/app/`: Contains the main application files:
- `layout.tsx`: Defines the layout for the Next.js application.
- `page.tsx`: Represents the main page of the application.
- `globals.css`: Global CSS styles.
- `favicon.ico`: The website’s icon.

#### `src/components/`: Contains UI components, further subdivided into:
- `atoms/`: Basic reusable components such as buttons, image input, icons, and inputs.
- `molecule/`: Components that combine atoms to create more complex elements, such as forms and banners.
- `organism/`: Larger components that serve as primary sections of a page, for example, the Home organism.

#### `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions and hooks.
- `libs/validator.ts`: Includes validation functions for form inputs.
- `hooks/useForm.ts`: A custom React hook for handling form logic.

#### Public Assets:
- `banner/public/`: Contains static assets such as images and SVG files (for example, file.svg, vercel.svg, next.svg, globe.svg, and window.svg). These are used in the UI.

#### Build and Cache Artifacts:
Files and directories beginning with `.next/` are generated by Next.js during build and development. They contain the build output, cache, server files, and static assets that Next.js uses to serve the application.

#### Version Control:
The `.git/` directory shows that the project is version controlled using Git.

## 2. Technologies and Tools Used

### Frameworks and Libraries

#### Next.js:
The presence of files like `next.config.ts`, `.next/`, and specific page files (`layout.tsx` and `page.tsx`) indicate that this is a Next.js application.
#### React:
Since Next.js is built on React, the use of `.tsx` files (React with TypeScript) implies the project is using React components.
#### TypeScript
The use of `.ts` and `.tsx` file extensions, along with a `tsconfig.json`, indicate that the project is written in TypeScript.
#### ESLint
Configuration file `eslint.config.mjs` implies the project uses ESLint for linting and code quality.
#### PostCSS:
The configuration in postcss.config.mjs suggests PostCSS is used to process CSS.

### Development and Build Tools

#### Node.js and npm:
The `package.json` file indicates dependency management and script running through Node.js and npm.
#### Git:
The presence of the `.git/` directory shows that version control is managed with Git.


## 3. What Does the Code Do?

### Application Functionality

#### UI and Layout:
- The `src/app/layout.tsx` file defines a common layout that wraps around the pages of the application. It includes shared elements like headers, footers, or navigation.
- The `src/app/page.tsx` file serves as the main landing page of the application.

#### Components:
- **Atoms**: Basic UI components like buttons, image inputs, icons, and inputs are defined here. These are the building blocks of the user interface.
- **Molecules**: These components, such as forms and banner components, combine several atoms to form more complex interactive parts of the UI.
- **Organisms**: Larger, self-contained components (e.g., the Home organism) which combine multiple molecules and atoms to form distinct sections of a page.

#### Utilities:
- Custom hooks like `useForm.ts` are used to manage form state and validation logic, while validator.ts includes helper functions to validate user input.

### Build and Deployment

#### Next.js Build Process:
- The `.next/` directory holds the output of the Next.js build process. It includes server-side rendered pages, static assets, and caching information.
- The configuration files (`next.config.ts` and `postcss.config.mjs`) set up the build process and styling pipelines.

### Styling and Assets

#### Global and Module-specific CSS:
- The `globals.css` file applies global styles across the application.
- Component-specific styles are included via CSS modules (for example, `imageInput.module.css` and `style.module.css` for the banner molecule).


## 4. Steps Taken and What Was Done

Based on the project structure, here are the steps that were taken in the development of this project:

### Project Initialization:
- A new Next.js project was created, using the command `npx create-next-app --typescript` to scaffold a TypeScript-based Next.js application.
- Git was initialized to track the project’s changes, as evidenced by the `.git` directory.

### Configuration Setup:
Configuration files were added/modified:
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for dependency management.
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.
- `next.config.ts` for Next.js-specific configuration.
- `postcss.config.mjs` for CSS processing.
- `eslint.config.mjs` for code linting standards.

### Development of Application Structure:
The application was structured following a component-based architecture:
- Atoms: Simple, reusable components were developed first.
- Molecules and Organisms: More complex UI components were then built by combining simpler components.

Pages and layout components were implemented under `src/app/`, defining how the application is rendered.

### Implementation of Utilities and Hooks:
Custom hooks (`useForm.ts`) and utility functions (`validator.ts`) were created to handle specific logic like form state management and validation.

### Asset Management:
Static assets such as images and icons were placed in the `public/` directory for easy serving by Next.js.

### Build and Deployment:
- Next.js was used to build the project, generating the `.next/` directory that contains build artifacts and server-rendered files.
- The project can be deployed on platforms that support Next.js, such as Vercel (evidenced by the presence of `vercel.svg` in the assets).

### Version Control and Code Quality:
- Git was used for version control.
ESLint and PostCSS were set up to ensure code quality and proper styling.


## 5. Summary

This project is a Next.js web application built using React, TypeScript, and various modern front-end tooling. The codebase is organized using a component-based architecture with clear separation between atoms, molecules, and organisms. Custom hooks and utility functions support interactive features like form handling and validation. The project is configured using industry-standard tools (ESLint, PostCSS, TypeScript) and is version-controlled using Git. The build artifacts are managed by Next.js and the project includes static assets that are served from the public directory.
